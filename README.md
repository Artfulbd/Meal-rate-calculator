Calculate everything on just one click.

*During my undergrad life, I stayed in a mess (some students rent a home and share all rent and bills). We need to calculate individual costs from the combined expense of everyone, which includes house rent, food, utility bills, internet connection, security fee, etc.).
 Everything needs to be calculated manually by us, which is a hassle as the cost ratio is not the same for everyone. So I made software to automate the calculation.
